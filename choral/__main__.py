                           [--balanced TRACK --predominant TRACK | --muted TRACK] [--tune]

MUSIC is a score file (docs/score-format.md) or a PDF exported from notation software.

  --part            tenor1, tenor2, baritone or bass (or several, with commas): also write that
                    part predominant (the others quiet behind it), muted (everyone else, to sing
                    against) and alone.  In three-part music "bass" is baritones and basses together
  --accompaniment   a recording of the accompaniment to sing over, instead of the built-in piano
  --balanced, --predominant, --muted
                    practice tracks of the same piece, if you have them (--predominant may list one
                    track per part named in --part, separated by commas).  They are only listened
                    to: the tempo and its bends, the hall and the balance are measured from them
  --tune            let a speech recognizer choose how close the microphones are (needs whisper-cli)
  --voice           a recording of 15-30 seconds of someone singing alone: the singers are given that
                    voice's sound.  Several recordings (with commas, or a folder of them) are seated
                    like a choir: one named for a part ("Bass 2.wav") sings there, the rest go by how
                    low each lies.  tools/vocalset_voices.py fetches ten men's voices to start with.
                    Needs the optional voice model - docs/how-it-works.md - and takes about a quarter as
                    long as all the singing lasts.  Use your own voice, or one whose owner has agreed
  --language        latin or english, when the program takes the words for the wrong one (it tells Latin by its words)
  --only            write just one version, e.g. --only "Baritone predominant"
  --read            read the music, say what was found, and stop there

What was estimated for the piece is saved beside the score as NAME.preset.json and reused.
