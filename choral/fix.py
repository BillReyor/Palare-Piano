"""Small corrections to a score, for the page's "Fix a note or a word" (choral/app.py).

A score file mirrors the printed page (docs/score-format.md): every measure has a line for each staff, the notes
written as they are printed and the syllables attached to them.  This module shows one measure the way the page
shows it - each staff's notes in order, where each sits on its staff, what it sounds as, the word under it - and
changes one note or one word in the file, leaving every other character of it as it was.

A note is moved the way one would point at the page: up or down a step on the staff, with or without a sharp, flat
or natural in front of it.  What it then sounds as follows from the key signature and from the accidentals earlier
in its measure, by the same rules the reader of the score applies (score._line), and is worked out here again so
that it can be shown and played before anything is sung.

Before the first change the score is copied beside itself (NAME.score.as-read), so that all of them can be undone."""
