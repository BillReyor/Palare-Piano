# Palare Piano

**Sheet music in, rehearsal tracks out.**

Give Palare Piano the sheet music for a piece your chorus is singing, tell it which part you
sing, and it makes practice tracks for you: your part louder than the rest, your part left out
so you can sing against the others, and your part all by itself. It is for tenor and bass
choruses (Tenor 1, Tenor 2, Baritone, Bass).

It runs on your own computer: a Mac, a Windows PC, or Linux. Your music is never sent anywhere.

## Before you start

You need one of these computers:

- **A Mac with an Apple chip, running macOS 14 or newer.** To check: click the Apple logo at the
  top-left corner of your screen, then **About This Mac**. Next to **Chip** it should say
  *Apple M1* (or M2, M3 and so on). Next to **macOS** the number should be 14 or higher. If it
  says *Intel*, this will not work on your Mac.
- **A Windows PC with Windows 10 or Windows 11.** Nearly every PC sold in the last ten years.
- **A Linux computer**, such as Ubuntu 22.04 or newer.

And:

- **An internet connection** while it installs.
- **About 2 GB of free space** (and 5 GB more if you later add real voices on a Mac).
- **About 10 minutes.**

You do not need to know anything about computers beyond clicking, typing and copy-and-paste.

**What is different on Windows and Linux?** Everything works except *real voices*, which need a
Mac with an Apple chip. You still get all five practice tracks with the built-in voices. Windows
and Linux are also newer here and have been tried less than the Mac: if something does not work,
please say so ([how](#if-something-is-not-right)).

**No suitable computer?** You may not need one. Someone in your chorus who has one can make the
tracks for every part and send them round: see
[Make tracks for your whole chorus](#make-tracks-for-your-whole-chorus). To play them you only
need a phone.

## Install it (once)

You will paste one line of text into a program that is already on your computer. It looks
technical; it is only three steps, and you never have to do it again. Follow the steps for your
computer: [a Mac](#on-a-mac), [a Windows PC](#on-a-windows-pc) or [Linux](#on-linux).

### On a Mac

**1. Open Terminal.**
Hold down the **Command** key (⌘, next to the space bar) and press the **space bar**. A search
box appears. Type `Terminal` and press **Return** (the big key on the right; some keyboards
call it Enter). A plain window with some text opens. That is Terminal.

**2. Copy this line.**
Move your mouse over the grey box below. A small copy button appears at its right end: click
it. (Or select the whole line and press ⌘C.)

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BillReyor/Palare-Piano/stable/install.sh | sh
```

**3. Paste it into Terminal and press Return.**
Click once inside the Terminal window, press **⌘V** to paste, then press **Return**.

Now wait. Terminal prints what it is doing. It is finished when it says
**"Palare Piano is installed."** and a page opens in your web browser. You can then close
Terminal.

> **If a window from Apple pops up** asking to install "command line developer tools", click
> **Install** (and **Agree** if it asks). This is a normal, free part of macOS that Palare Piano
> needs. It can take 15 minutes. When it finishes, the Terminal window carries on by itself.

It does not ask for your password and does not change anything else on your Mac.

### On a Windows PC

**1. Open PowerShell.**
Click the **Start** button (the Windows logo at the bottom of the screen), type `PowerShell`,
and press **Enter**. A dark window with some text opens. That is PowerShell; it is part of
Windows.

**2. Copy this line.**
Move your mouse over the grey box below. A small copy button appears at its right end: click
it. (Or select the whole line and press Ctrl+C.)

```
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BillReyor/Palare-Piano/stable/install.ps1 | iex
```

**3. Paste it into PowerShell and press Enter.**
Click once inside the PowerShell window, press **Ctrl+V** to paste, then press **Enter**.

Now wait. PowerShell prints what it is doing. It is finished when it says
**"Palare Piano is installed."** and a page opens in your web browser. You can then close
PowerShell.

It does not ask for an administrator and does not change anything else on your PC.

### On Linux

**1. Open a terminal.** On Ubuntu, press **Ctrl+Alt+T**.

**2. Copy this line**, paste it into the terminal (**Ctrl+Shift+V**) and press **Enter**.

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BillReyor/Palare-Piano/stable/install.sh | sh
```

If it answers *wget: command not found*, use the line in the Mac steps above instead: it does
the same thing with a different fetching program.

It is finished when it says **"Palare Piano is installed."** and a page opens in your web
browser. It does not ask for your password.

## Open it next time

Palare Piano is now an app on your computer.

- **On a Mac:** hold **Command** (⌘) and press the **space bar**, type `Palare Piano` and press
  **Return**. (You can also find it in **Finder**: click **Go** in the menu bar at the top of the
  screen, then **Home**, then open the **Applications** folder you see there.)
- **On Windows:** double-click the **Palare Piano** icon on your Desktop. Or click **Start**,
  type `Palare Piano` and press **Enter**.
- **On Linux:** open your applications menu and choose **Palare Piano**.

It opens as a page in your web browser (Safari, Chrome, Edge or whichever you use). It is not a
website: it is running on your own computer, and it works without the internet.

**The page's address is <http://127.0.0.1:8765>.** If you closed the page, type that into your
browser to get it back, or keep it as a bookmark. Only this computer can open it.

- It works while Palare Piano is running, and Palare Piano keeps running after you close the page.
  If your browser says it cannot connect (after the computer was restarted, say), open Palare
  Piano as described above.
- If something else on your computer was already using that address, Palare Piano takes the next
  one: the number at the end is 8766, or the next free one up to 8789. Opening the app always
  takes you to the right one.

## Make your first tracks

**1. Add your sheet music.**
Click **Add your sheet music** and choose the PDF, or drag the PDF onto the page. A PDF from your
director works best. A scan or a photo-copy saved as a PDF works too.

No PDF handy? Click **Try a short demo first**.

**2. Wait while it reads the music.**
A few seconds for a clean PDF; about half a minute for each page of a scan.

**3. Choose your part, and how it should sound.**

![Choosing a part](docs/pictures/2-choose.jpg)

- **Quick listen** takes about a minute. The voices are clear but sound like a machine. Good for
  checking your notes.
- **Real voices** sound like people singing, and take much longer (see below).

**4. Click "Make my tracks".**
You can leave it working and close the window. It carries on, and your computer plays a short
sound when the tracks are ready. (To turn the sound off, untick **Play a sound when tracks are
ready** under your pieces.)

**5. Press play and sing along.**
While a track plays, the page shows which measure you are hearing. To start somewhere else, type
a measure number in **Start from measure** and click **Play from there**.

To work on a hard passage, type its first and last measure after **Repeat measures** and click
**Repeat**: it plays over and over until you click **Stop repeating**. **Speed** plays any track
slower, down to half speed, at the same pitch. Nothing has to be made again for either.

A little singer stands beside the track that is playing and sings along, as a reminder of two
things a choir is always told:

- **The shape of the mouth.** It opens with each note of your part in the shape of the vowel: tall
  for "ah", lips forward for "oh" and "oo", a narrow "ee". A word like "my" stays on "ah" and
  turns only at the very end, and a last consonant closes where the note stops. Click the singer
  for a close look at the mouth; click again to step back.
- **When to breathe.** Before each entrance it breathes in, and a breath mark (’) appears beside
  it. A comma in the words is a quick breath. Where a phrase is too long for one breath it says
  to stagger your breathing.

On the track with your part left out, it shows you when to come in. Each track has its own singer,
and they are not all alike: young and older, every skin tone, some in glasses, some with a thick
chain or with plugs in their ears, and now and then a grumpy one. If you would rather not see
them, untick **Show the little singer** under your pieces.

**Your director's breaths.** Where you have been told to breathe, or not to, mark it: open **Fix a
note or a word**, click the note, and choose **Breathe here** or **No breath here** for what
happens after that note. The singer follows your marks. (They do not change how the voices on the
tracks are sung.)

![The finished tracks](docs/pictures/3-tracks.jpg)

| Track | What you hear |
|---|---|
| **Balanced** | The whole choir with the piano |
| **Your part predominant** | Your part louder than everyone else |
| **Your part muted** | Everyone except your part, so you can sing your line against them |
| **Your part alone** | Just your part |
| **Voices only** | The choir without the piano |

## Put the tracks on your phone

Click **Show the files** (on a Mac, **Show the files in Finder**). A folder opens with your
tracks in it. From there:

- **On a Mac, AirDrop:** select the tracks, right-click, choose **Share**, then **AirDrop**,
  then your iPhone.
- **On any computer:** attach them to an email or a message to yourself, or put them in a folder
  your phone can see (iCloud Drive, Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox).

All your pieces are kept in the **Music** folder on your computer, inside a folder called
**Palare Piano**.

## What will work on my computer?

The first time it opens, Palare Piano tries your computer out for a few seconds. Near the bottom
of the page, **What this computer can do** then lists each thing with a tick, a "works, slowly"
or a cross, and how long a three-minute piece will take. Anything that will not work on your
computer is switched off in the choices, with the reason.

If real voices will not work on your computer, you can still use **Quick listen**, or ask
someone with a newer Mac to make the tracks for everyone (next section).

## Make tracks for your whole chorus

One person can make the tracks for everybody, so that nobody else has to install anything.

1. Under **Which part do you sing?** choose **Every part, to share**.
2. Make the tracks as usual. It takes hardly any longer than making one part.
3. Click **Get the files to share**. A folder opens with one zip file for each part.
4. Send each section its file: by email, by AirDrop, or in a shared folder (Google Drive, Dropbox,
   iCloud).

Each singer opens their section's file on a phone or a computer and presses play. Every file
holds the same five tracks, made for that part.

![Tracks for every part](docs/pictures/4-everyone.jpg)

## Real voices (optional, on a Mac)

Out of the box, the choir is sung by built-in voices. On a Mac with an Apple chip you can add
real recorded voices so the tracks sound like people singing.

- On the Palare Piano page, click **Add real voices**. It is a 4 GB download, once.
- After that, choose **Real voices** when you make your tracks.
- Real-voice tracks are slow to make: roughly **ten minutes for every minute of music** with the
  full choir, about a third of that with the small choir. Start it, leave your Mac plugged in,
  and come back later.
- Not on a Mac? Someone who is can make real-voice tracks for every part and share them
  ([Make tracks for your whole chorus](#make-tracks-for-your-whole-chorus)).

## If something is not right

**Something went wrong, or it read your music badly.**
Near the bottom of the Palare Piano page, click **Save a report**. It saves a small text file
with your downloads. Send that file, with a few words about what happened, to whoever asked you
to try Palare Piano. The file holds the version, what kind of computer you have, and what the
program noted about your pieces. Your sheet music and your tracks are not in it, and you can open
it and read it first.

If you use GitHub, you can instead [open an issue](https://github.com/BillReyor/Palare-Piano/issues/new/choose)
and attach the file there. Please do not post sheet music or recordings on that page: it is
public.

**"The reader was unsure about some places."**
Normal, especially for scans, and most pieces still come out fine. To check them, click **Go
through them, one by one**. Each place opens in the music with a plain sentence saying what the
reader was unsure of, and the notes in question marked in yellow. Put it right there, or click
**It is right as it is**, and it moves on to the next.

**A note or a word is wrong.**
You can fix it on the page, with your sheet music beside you. If you hear it while a track is
playing, click **Fix measure …** under the player: it stops the track and opens the music at the
measure you were hearing. Otherwise:

1. Under the piece, click **Fix a note or a word**.
2. Go to the measure: type its number, use the arrows, or type a word from the lyrics and click
   **Find**. Each measure is drawn the way it looks in your music.
3. **A wrong note:** click it, then click **Higher** or **Lower** until it sits where your
   music has it. Sharp, flat and natural are there too. You hear the note each time.
4. **A wrong word:** type the right one in the box under its note.
   **A note that is spoken, not sung** (an x for its head in your music): click it, then click
   **Spoken**.
5. Click **Hear this measure** to check it, then **Done**, then **Make the tracks again**. Only
   what you changed is sung again.

![Fixing a note or a word](docs/pictures/5-fix.jpg)

**Undo all my changes** puts everything back as it was first read.

**"No tempo is printed in this music."**
Type the tempo your director takes (beats a minute) into the box and click **Set the tempo**.

**"This could not be read as music."**
The PDF may not be a tenor and bass choir score, or the scan may be too faint or crooked. Try a
cleaner copy.

**A scan came out with the notes but without the words (Windows and Linux).**
A Mac can read printed words by itself. Windows and Linux need a free program called Tesseract
for that. Music saved as a PDF straight from notation software does not need it; only scans and
photocopies do.

- *On Linux:* open a terminal, paste `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr` and press Enter. It asks
  for your password.
- *On Windows:* open PowerShell as in the install steps, paste
  `winget install -e --id UB-Mannheim.TesseractOCR` and press Enter. Click **Yes** when Windows
  asks for permission.

Then click **Remove this piece** and add the PDF again. (Reading scans this way has been tried
on Linux, not yet on Windows.)

**It is taking a very long time.**
Real voices are slow; the page shows how much is left. A long piece with the full choir can take
over an hour. Use **Quick listen** when you are in a hurry.

**I closed the page. Where did it go?**
Open Palare Piano again the same way you opened it before (see
[Open it next time](#open-it-next-time)), or type <http://127.0.0.1:8765> into your browser.
Anything it was making has carried on.

**How do I update it?**
Palare Piano looks for a newer version by itself. (What it offers is the newest version that has
passed its tests on a Mac, on Windows and on Linux.) When there is one, the top of the page says
**A newer version of Palare Piano is ready**: click **Update now**. It takes about a minute, and
your pieces and tracks are kept. If it is in the middle of making tracks, let it finish first.
(Doing the three install steps again does the same thing.)

**How do I remove it?**
Do the install steps again, but paste the line for your computer from below instead. Your pieces
and tracks stay in your Music folder.

On a Mac:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BillReyor/Palare-Piano/stable/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall
```

On Windows:

```
$env:PALARE_UNINSTALL = 1; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BillReyor/Palare-Piano/stable/install.ps1 | iex
```

On Linux:

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BillReyor/Palare-Piano/stable/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall
```

## Good to know

- **It is a practice aid, not a performance.** It reads the page and sings what it finds. It
  can misread a note or a word, more often on scans.
- **Tenor and bass choirs only** (four parts, or three), with piano or unaccompanied.
- **English and church Latin.** Other languages are sung as if spelled in English.
- **Your music stays on your computer.** The internet is used only to download Palare Piano itself
  and, if you add them, the real voices, and to ask whether a newer version exists.
- **Sharing tracks made with real voices?** Each piece's folder has a small file called
  *Credits*. Keep it with the tracks: the voices belong to real singers who allowed their use on
  that condition.

## Why "Palare Piano"?

*Palare* is one spelling of Polari, the slang gay men in Britain once spoke so as not to be
overheard. *Piano* means "softly". Say the two together and you hear *player piano*, the piano
that plays itself. This one sings. ([The longer story](docs/about.md#the-name).)
